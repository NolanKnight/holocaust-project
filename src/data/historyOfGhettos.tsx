const historyOfGhettos =
  "The first ghetto was built in 1516 in Venice, Italy. Other ghettos were created to hold Jews in the following centuries, but it was not until WWII that the world saw ghettos being built at the scale at which the Nazis did so. In October 1930, Nazi Germany built its first ghetto in Poland. One ghetto, the Warsaw ghetto, held 40,000 Jews in 1.3 square miles. Before the “Final Solution” in 1941, the Nazis had made at least 1,143 ghettos.";
